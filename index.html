      <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m Utku BarÄ±ÅŸ SelÃ§uk ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        I'm a computer engineer with a focus on mobile app development. With over two years of
        professional experience, I am dedicated to continually improving and refining my skills. Outside of work, I find
        joy in simple pleasures such as savoring a well-made cup of coffee. I approach each project with a dedication to
        finding effective solutions through problem-solving and aim to contribute innovative ideas.

        I don't know what you want to find, but you won't find it here right
        now. Letâ€™s be honest. I have no clue what this website will become.
        Right now, itâ€™s a blank canvas, waiting for inspiration to strike.
